# Task Graph MCP Server Prompts Configuration
#
# Override LLM-facing instructions and tool descriptions.
# Create prompts.yaml in:
#   - task-graph/prompts.yaml (project-level)
#   - ~/.task-graph/prompts.yaml (user-level)
#
# Server instructions shown to the LLM at MCP initialization.
# This is the FIRST thing an LLM sees. Make it count.
# instructions: |
#   Task graph for multi-agent coordination.
#   Start: connect() -> list_tasks(ready=true) -> claim() -> work -> update(status="completed").
#   Use get_skill("basics") for full documentation.
#   Use get_skill("worker") or get_skill("coordinator") for role-specific guidance.
#   Available workflows: solo, swarm, relay, hierarchical. Pass workflow="name" to connect().

# Tool description overrides
# These override the compiled-in descriptions and are always visible to the LLM.
# Use them to add project-specific behavioral hints.
#
# tools:
#   thinking:
#     description: |
#       Broadcast status + heartbeat. Call every 2-5 minutes while working.
#       Silent agents get evicted after 5 minutes. Your thought is visible to
#       coordinators and other agents for real-time coordination.
#   mark_file:
#     description: |
#       Mark files BEFORE editing. Advisory lock that signals intent to other agents.
#       Always mark all files upfront, not one at a time. Returns warnings if
#       another agent has already marked the file -- coordinate or pick different work.
#   claim:
#     description: |
#       Claim a task to start working on it. Sets status to working and starts the timer.
#       After claiming: read attachments for context, mark_file() before editing,
#       call thinking() regularly for heartbeat. Use list_tasks(ready=true) to find
#       claimable tasks filtered by your tags.
#   attach:
#     description: |
#       Add artifacts to a task. Use for: results, notes, commit hashes, test output,
#       gate artifacts. Gate types (gate/tests, gate/commit, etc.) satisfy workflow gates.
#       Use type="note" for general observations, type="result" for structured outcomes.
