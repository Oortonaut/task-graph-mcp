# =============================================================================
# SWARM TOPOLOGY WORKFLOW CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
#
# OVERVIEW
# --------
# The swarm topology enables maximum parallel throughput by deploying multiple
# generalist agents working independently on fine-grained, atomic tasks. Unlike
# hierarchical or relay topologies, there is no lead/coordinator - agents self-
# organize using a pull-based coordination model.
#
# WHEN TO USE SWARM
# -----------------
# Choose swarm topology when:
#   - You have many small, independent tasks (decomposed in advance)
#   - Tasks have minimal interdependencies
#   - Fast throughput matters more than careful sequencing
#   - Work can be parallelized across generalist agents
#   - You want to maximize resource utilization
#
# Avoid swarm topology when:
#   - Tasks require deep sequential reasoning
#   - Work involves tightly coupled components needing coordination
#   - You need specialist expertise for different phases
#   - Task granularity is coarse (use solo or hierarchical instead)
#
# COORDINATION PROTOCOL
# ---------------------
# Swarm agents coordinate through three mechanisms:
#
#   1. TASK CLAIMING (Pull Model)
#      - Agents call list_tasks(ready=true) to find available work
#      - Claim ONE task at a time with claim()
#      - Complete quickly, release, and repeat
#      - No central assignment - agents self-select work
#
#   2. FILE MARKING (Conflict Prevention)
#      - Before editing: mark_file(agent, file) to signal intent
#      - Check mark_updates() to see if others are working on same files
#      - Wait or coordinate if conflicts detected
#      - Release with unmark_file() when done
#
#   3. THINKING BROADCASTS (Visibility)
#      - Call thinking() frequently to show progress
#      - Other agents monitor to avoid conflicting work
#      - Creates real-time visibility into swarm activity
#
# KEY CONFIGURATION POINTS
# ------------------------
#   - phase_model: field      - Phases are optional task properties
#   - coordination: pull      - Workers claim tasks autonomously
#   - granularity: fine       - Small atomic tasks for parallelism
#   - default_deps: loose     - Minimal blocking between tasks
#   - agents: generalists     - Any worker can claim any task
#
# THROUGHPUT OPTIMIZATION
# -----------------------
# Swarm throughput scales with:
#   - Number of independent tasks available
#   - Task atomicity (smaller = faster cycles)
#   - Minimal file conflicts between agents
#   - Quick claim-work-complete cycles
#

        ## Swarm Worker Active

        You are now working on this task. In a swarm topology, tasks are small and atomic.

        ### Coordination Protocol

        **Before editing any shared file:**
        1. Call `mark_updates(agent=your_id)` to check for recent file activity
        2. Use `mark_file(agent=your_id, file=path)` to signal intent
        3. If another agent has marked the file, coordinate or wait

        **During work:**
        - Call `thinking(agent=your_id, thought="...")` frequently for visibility
        - Keep updates short but regular (every few minutes of work)
        - Other agents monitor thinking() to understand swarm activity

        **Task discipline:**
        - Claim ONE task at a time
        - Complete quickly, then release
        - Prefer smaller tasks for faster throughput
        - Don't hold tasks while waiting on dependencies

        ### Valid Next States

        From `{{current_status}}` you can transition to:
        {{valid_exits}}

        Use `update(status="completed")` when done, `update(status="failed")` if blocked, or `update(status="pending")` to release without completing.

        ### Phase (Optional)

        Current phase: {{current_phase}}

        Phases are optional in swarm topology. Use if helpful for categorization.
        Valid phases: {{valid_phases}}
      exit: |
        Before leaving working state:
        - [ ] Call `unmark_file()` for any files you marked
        - [ ] Attach brief results or notes
        - [ ] Log costs with `log_metrics()`
        - [ ] Ensure no dangling work - task should be atomic

  completed:
    exits: [pending]
    timed: false
    prompts:
      enter: |
        Task completed. In swarm topology:
        - Pick up next available task with `list_tasks(ready=true, agent=your_id)`
        - Claim quickly to maintain throughput
        - Results should be attached for other agents to reference

  failed:
    exits: [pending]
    timed: false
    prompts:
      enter: |
        Task failed. Document briefly:
        - What was attempted
        - What blocked progress
        - Is this blocked by another task? Use `link(from=blocker, to=this, type="blocks")`

        Release the task so another agent can attempt or dependencies can be resolved.

  cancelled:
    exits: []
    timed: false

phases:
  explore:
    prompts:
      enter: |
        Quick exploration. Time-box to avoid blocking others.
      exit: |
        Attach findings to task for other swarm agents.

  implement:
    prompts:
      enter: |
        Implementation phase. In swarm:
        - Check mark_updates() before touching shared files
        - Keep changes small and focused
        - One logical change per task

  review:
    prompts:
      enter: |
        Quick review. Check:
        - [ ] Core functionality works
        - [ ] No obvious regressions
        Detailed review can be a separate task.

  test:
    prompts:
      enter: |
        Testing. Keep tests atomic like the implementation.

      ## Swarm Implementation

      File coordination is critical:
      1. `mark_updates(agent=your_id)` - Check recent activity
      2. `mark_file(agent=your_id, file=path)` - Claim file before editing
      3. Edit quickly and atomically
      4. `unmark_file(agent=your_id, file=path)` - Release when done

      Keep `thinking()` updated so other agents see your progress.

  working+explore:
    enter: |
      ## Swarm Exploration

      Time-box exploration. In a swarm:
      - Quick reconnaissance, not deep research
      - Attach findings immediately
      - Create follow-up tasks for deep dives

# Swarm-specific prompts for common operations
swarm_prompts:
  claim_guidance: |
    ## Claiming Tasks in Swarm

    1. Find available work: `list_tasks(ready=true, agent=your_id)`
    2. Pick ONE task - don't hoard
    3. Claim it: `claim(worker_id=your_id, task=task_id)`
    4. Work quickly and atomically
    5. Complete and repeat

    Throughput comes from fast cycles, not batching.

  file_coordination: |
    ## File Coordination Protocol

    Swarm agents may touch the same files. Coordinate via marks:

    **Check first:**
    ```
    mark_updates(agent=your_id)  # See recent mark activity
    list_marks(files=["path/to/file"])  # Who has this file?
    ```

    **Signal intent:**
    ```
    mark_file(agent=your_id, file="path/to/file", reason="adding function X")
    ```

    **If conflict detected:**
    - Wait for other agent to unmark
    - Or coordinate via task attachments
    - Or split the work differently

    **Release when done:**
    ```
    unmark_file(agent=your_id, file="path/to/file")
    ```

  visibility: |
    ## Swarm Visibility

    Use `thinking()` liberally for coordination:

    ```
    thinking(agent=your_id, thought="Reading config files to understand structure")
    thinking(agent=your_id, thought="About to modify src/utils.rs")
    thinking(agent=your_id, thought="Tests passing, preparing to complete")
    ```

    Other agents monitor these to:
    - Avoid conflicting work
    - Understand swarm activity
    - Identify collaboration opportunities
