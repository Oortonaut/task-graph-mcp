# Role definitions for specialists
roles:
  designer:
    description: Creates specifications and designs for features
    tags: [designer, design]
    phases: [design, explore]
    prompts:
      claim: |
        Design task. Deliver: problem statement, solution approach, interfaces, edge cases, acceptance criteria.
        Attach design doc for implementer handoff.
      handoff: "Ensure design spec attached, impl notes added, acceptance criteria explicit."

  implementer:
    description: Implements features based on designs
    tags: [implementer, implement, code]
    phases: [implement, integrate]
    prompts:
      claim: |
        Read design spec first. `mark_file()` before editing. Follow patterns. Tests alongside code.
        Never revert unfamiliar changes - check `mark_updates()`. Ask designer before guessing.
      handoff: "Ensure code committed, tests passing, self-reviewed, design deviations documented."

  reviewer:
    description: Reviews implementations for quality and correctness
    tags: [reviewer, review]
    phases: [review, security]
    prompts:
      claim: |
        Review against design spec. Check correctness, test coverage, edge cases, error handling, security.
        Document findings before approval/rejection.
      handoff: "Ensure approval/rejection clear. Rejected: list issues. Approved: note test focus areas."

  tester:
    description: Validates implementations through comprehensive testing
    tags: [tester, test, qa]
    phases: [test]
    prompts:
      claim: |
        Read design spec + acceptance criteria + review notes. Run suite, test edges and errors.
        Document results thoroughly.
      handoff: "Ensure results attached, pass/fail clear, failures documented or coverage noted."

# State configuration
states:
  pending:
    exits: [assigned, working, cancelled]
    timed: false

  assigned:
    exits: [working, pending, cancelled]
    timed: false
    prompts:
      enter: "Assigned by coordinator. Review and claim when ready, or reject to pending."

  working:
    exits: [completed, failed, pending, consult]
    timed: true
    prompts:
      enter: |
        **Relay working.** Protocol: receive attachments -> process -> document -> handoff.

        - Never revert unfamiliar changes: check `mark_updates()` / `list_marks()` first
        - `list_marks()` before editing for conflicts
        - 5+ files? Decompose first
        - `thinking()` regularly for heartbeat; `mark_updates()` every 30-60s
        - Stale workers (5+ min no heartbeat) get evicted
        - **Git lock**: `claim(task="_lock:git-commit")` -> commit -> release via `update(task="_lock:git-commit", status="pending")`

        Transitions: {{valid_exits}}
        Phase: {{current_phase}} | Valid: {{valid_phases}}

      exit: "Deliverables attached, handoff notes clear, files unmarked, `log_metrics()`."

  completed:
    exits: [pending]
    timed: false
    prompts:
      enter: "Phase complete. Coordinator routes to next specialist."

  failed:
    exits: [pending]
    timed: false
    prompts:
      enter: "Phase failed. Document: attempted, blocker, retry or escalate."

  consult:
    exits: [working, pending, cancelled]
    timed: false
    prompts:
      enter: "**Paused for human review.** Attach note explaining decision needed."

  cancelled:
    exits: []
    timed: false

# Phase configuration
phases:
  design:
    prompts:
      enter: "**Design.** Create spec for implementers. Output: design doc + testable acceptance criteria."
      exit: "Ensure spec attached (`gate/spec`), criteria testable, handoff notes included."

  implement:
    prompts:
      enter: "**Implement.** Build per design spec. `mark_file()` first. Ask designer if unclear."
      exit: "Ensure commit attached (`gate/commit`), impl notes attached, tests pass, handoff notes included."

  review:
    prompts:
      enter: "**Review.** Verify impl matches design. Be specific about issues."
      exit: "Ensure approval attached (`gate/approval`). Rejected: list fixes. Approved: note test focus."

  test:
    prompts:
      enter: "**Test.** Validate end-to-end. Document failures with repro steps."

      exit: "Ensure findings attached, critical issues block relay until resolved."

  triage:
    prompts:
      enter: "**Triage.** Determine relay sequence, set tags for first specialist, capture requirements."
      exit: "Ensure requirements captured, routed to first specialist."

  diagnose:
    prompts:
      enter: "**Diagnose.** Reproduce, identify code paths, document fix approach for implementer."
      exit: "Ensure root cause documented, fix approach attached."

  plan:
    prompts:
      enter: "**Plan.** Outline relay sequence: which phases, which gate artifacts at each handoff."

  doc:
    prompts:
      enter: "**Document.** Update API docs, README, comments. Verify examples match implementation."

  deliver:
    prompts:
      enter: "**Deliver.** Verify all gate artifacts attached, full relay chain completed. Changelog if applicable."

    prompts:
      enter: "**Deploy.** Build verified, tests green. Tag release if applicable. Monitor post-deploy."

  monitor:
