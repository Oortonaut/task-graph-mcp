# ============================================================================
# RELAY WORKFLOW TOPOLOGY
# ============================================================================
#
# Overview:
#   The relay topology orchestrates work through sequential specialist handoffs,
#   similar to a relay race where each runner (specialist) completes their leg
#   before passing the baton to the next.
#
# When to Use:
#   - Projects requiring distinct expertise at each phase (design, implement,
#     review, test)
#   - Work that benefits from fresh eyes at each stage
#   - Teams with specialized roles rather than generalists
#   - Features where quality gates between phases are critical
#   - When you want clear accountability for each phase's deliverables
#
# When NOT to Use:
#   - Simple tasks a single agent can complete end-to-end (use solo)
#   - Highly parallel independent work (use swarm)
#   - Dynamic task decomposition at runtime (use hierarchical)
#   - Tight iteration loops where the same person should design and implement
#
# Specialist Roles:
#   1. Designer    - Creates specifications and acceptance criteria
#   2. Implementer - Builds code following the design spec
#   3. Reviewer    - Validates implementation against spec, checks quality
#   4. Tester      - Comprehensive testing against acceptance criteria
#
# Handoff Protocol:
#   Each specialist must:
#   1. RECEIVE - Read all attachments from the previous specialist
#   2. PROCESS - Complete their phase's work
#   3. DOCUMENT - Attach deliverables (design spec, impl notes, review, etc.)
#   4. HANDOFF - Mark complete with clear notes for the next specialist
#
#   Attachments flow through the relay:
#   - design spec (designer -> all downstream)
#   - impl-notes (implementer -> reviewer, tester)
#   - review findings (reviewer -> tester)
#   - test-results (tester -> coordinator)
#
# Coordination Style:
#   Push-based - A coordinator assigns tasks to the appropriate specialist
#   based on their role tags. Specialists don't pull work; they receive
#   assignments and hand off when complete.
#
# Key Configuration Points:
#   - phase_model: subtask - Each phase becomes a child task owned by specialist
#   - coordination: push - Coordinator routes work to specialists
#   - default_deps: sequential - Tasks flow with 'follows' dependencies
#   - roles section defines specialist capabilities and prompts
#   - handoff_protocol section documents attachment conventions
#
# Example Flow:
#   Feature "Add search" created
#   -> Design subtask assigned to designer
#   -> Designer completes, attaches spec, marks complete
#   -> Implement subtask assigned to implementer
#   -> Implementer reads spec, codes, attaches notes, marks complete
#   -> Review subtask assigned to reviewer
#   -> Reviewer checks code vs spec, attaches findings, marks complete
#   -> Test subtask assigned to tester
#   -> Tester validates, attaches results, marks complete
#   -> Feature complete

# State configuration with relay-specific prompts
states:
  pending:
    exits: [assigned, working, cancelled]
    timed: false

  assigned:
    exits: [working, pending, cancelled]
    timed: false
    prompts:
      enter: |
        A task has been assigned to you by the coordinator.

        ## Before Claiming
        - Review the task description
        - Check for prerequisite attachments
        - Verify you have the required expertise (check your role)

        Claim when ready with `claim()` or reject back to pending if misrouted.

  working:
    exits: [completed, failed, pending]
    timed: true
    prompts:
      enter: |
        You are now actively working on this task.

        ## Relay Protocol

        1. **Receive**: Read all attachments from previous specialist
        2. **Process**: Complete your phase's work
        3. **Document**: Attach your deliverables
        4. **Handoff**: Complete with clear notes for next specialist

        Keep your thinking updated regularly using the `thinking` tool.

        ### Valid Transitions
        - `completed` - Phase complete, ready for handoff
        - `failed` - Blocked, needs coordinator intervention
        - `pending` - Release for reassignment

      exit: |
        Before completing:
        - [ ] Deliverables attached
        - [ ] Handoff notes clear
        - [ ] Files unmarked
        - [ ] Costs logged with `log_metrics()`

  completed:
    exits: [pending]
    timed: false
    prompts:
      enter: |
        Phase completed. Your deliverables should be attached.

        The coordinator will route this to the next specialist in the relay.

  failed:
    exits: [pending]
    timed: false
    prompts:
      enter: |
        Phase failed. Document clearly for coordinator:
        - What was attempted
        - What blocked progress
        - Whether to retry or escalate
        - Suggested next steps

  cancelled:
    exits: []
    timed: false
