    prompts:
      enter: |
        **Hierarchical working.** `thinking()` regularly for heartbeat + visibility.

        - Never revert unfamiliar changes: check `mark_updates()` / `list_marks()` first
        - `list_marks()` before editing to check conflicts
        - 5+ files? Decompose into subtasks first
        - `mark_updates()` every 30-60s during long ops
        - Stale workers (5+ min no heartbeat) get evicted
        - **Git lock**: `claim(task="_lock:git-commit")` -> commit -> release via `update(task="_lock:git-commit", status="pending")`

        Transitions: {{valid_exits}}
        Phase: {{current_phase}} | Valid: {{valid_phases}}

      exit: "Unmark files, attach results, `log_metrics()`."

  completed:
    exits: [pending]
    timed: false
    prompts:
      enter: Task completed. Results should be attached.

  failed:
    exits: [pending]
    timed: false
    prompts:
      enter: |
        Task failed. Document: what was attempted, what blocked, suggested next steps.

  consult:
    exits: [working, pending, cancelled]
    timed: false
    prompts:
      enter: |
        **Paused for human review.** Attach a note explaining what decision is needed.
        A human (or lead) must transition this back to `working` or `pending`.

    exits: []

# State+Phase combos
combos:
  working+implement:
    enter: |
      Implementing. Follow patterns, tests alongside, atomic commits.
      - **3+ files**: search ALL symbols first, mark_file() ALL, plan attachment before coding
      - **Git lock**: `claim(task="_lock:git-commit")` -> commit -> `update(task="_lock:git-commit", status="pending")`

  working+review:
    enter: "Review: correctness, edge cases, test coverage."

  working+plan:
    enter: "Planning: decompose into atomic subtasks, set deps, estimate effort."

  working+explore:

  working+test:
    enter: "Testing: run suite, add tests, verify edges. Attach results."

  working+triage:
    enter: "Triaging: categorize, prioritize, assess scope. Route or decompose."

  working+diagnose:
    enter: "Diagnosing: reproduce, narrow down, root cause. Attach findings before fix tasks."

  working+security:

# Role-specific prompts
role_prompts:
  lead:
    decomposition: |
      Decompose into atomic, independent, testable subtasks via `create_tree()`.
      Set `time_estimate_ms` and `points` on each.

    assignment: |
      Assign via `update(task="id", assignee="worker-id")`.
      Prefer workers with matching tags, lower claim counts, or related context.

    monitoring: |
      Monitor: `list_agents()` for active workers, `list_tasks(status="working")` for active work.
      Watch for long-running tasks, overloaded workers, blocked deps.
      Reassign: `update(task="id", assignee="other-worker", force=true)`.

  worker:
    claiming: |
      1. `list_tasks(ready=true, agent="your-id")` - find qualified tasks by priority
      2. `claim(task="id", worker_id="your-id")`
      3. `mark_file()` before editing
      4. Never revert unfamiliar changes - check `mark_updates()` first
      Claim one at a time. Check attachments for lead context.

    completing: |
      Before completing:
      1. Verify success criteria met
      2. Run tests
      3. `attach(type="result", content="...")` - document work done
      4. `unmark_file()` - release files
      5. `log_metrics(cost_usd=...)` - record cost
      6. `update(status="completed")`

    reporting: |
      Use `thinking(thought="...")` frequently with status, blockers, ETA.
      Longer tasks: `attach(type="progress", content="...")`.
      Blocked: `update(status="failed", reason="...")`.
      Questions: `attach(type="question", content="...")`.
